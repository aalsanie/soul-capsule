# soul-capsule: A Damn Good Compression Algorithm with Style

> *"What if your AI didn’t just respond, but remembered? Not just context, but you — your style, your rhythm, your soul."*

**soul-capsule** is a decentralized, local-first AI assistant designed to evolve with you. It’s not a chatbot. Not a tool. It’s a **compression algorithm for the self** — capturing your patterns, thoughts, emotional tone, and digital rhythm to help you think better, live lighter, and connect deeper with your own mind.

## Why?

Today’s GenAI systems are stateless. Contextless. Faceless. You ask — it responds — and forgets. Every prompt is a reset.

We believe in something more intimate:
- An AI that *remembers you* — your tone, your logic, your ideas.
- An AI that *compresses* months of thought into a single word or nudge.
- An AI that *lives with you*, not in the cloud — privately, securely, and freely.

## Core Principles

- **Decentralized**: No central server. You own your data, your model, your mind.
- **Personalized**: Learns from your text, tone, behavior, and feedback loops.
- **Local-first**: Runs on your machine. No internet? No problem.
- **Compression with Style**: Encodes not just meaning, but emotion, preference, rhythm.
- **Multimodal Memory** (future): Beyond text — include voice tone, images, location, state.

## Architecture

### MVP Scope
For the first prototype, we focus on:
- **Local context engine** (vector store of recent interactions + files)
- **Personal memory store** (ChromaDB or SQLite + embeddings)
- **Lightweight LLM agent** (Ollama or Bedrock wrapper)
- **Chat interface** (CLI, VSCode plugin, or minimal web UI)
- **Style fingerprint**: Sentence-level tone and structure matching

## Example Use Cases

- Summarize your day in *your tone*
- Give suggestions based on recent code and conversations
- Compose emails or notes that “sound like you”
- Reflect on how your thinking has changed over time
- Remember forgotten goals or unfinished thoughts from weeks ago

## Tech Stack

- **LLM Engine**: Mistral, Phi, Claude (via Bedrock), or GPT via OpenRouter
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB or LanceDB
- **Interface**: Python CLI, Electron app, VS Code extension (TBD)
- **Memory Manager**: Flat file, SQLite, or local secure storage
- **Style Matching**: Sentence embeddings + stylometry tools

## Long-Term Vision

We imagine an ecosystem of:
- **Personal agents** that sync across devices without needing the cloud
- **Style capsules** — compressed representations of your thinking style
- **Contextual OS integration**: aware of time, weather, music, mood
- **Encrypted mind backups**: restore your thought fingerprints across time

## License

To be decided. Open to **source-available** models or full open source depending on future direction.

## Status

This is the foundation. A small experiment pointing at a much bigger idea.
We’re starting with a hackathon-friendly MVP — and building from there.
