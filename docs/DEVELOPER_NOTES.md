# Developer Notes: Soul Capsule Backend

## 🛠️ Philosophy of Design

Soul Capsule is built with an uncompromising commitment to **privacy**, **local ownership**, and **personal memory integrity**.

Unlike typical cloud-first AI systems, we:
- **Run everything locally**: no external servers, no silent telemetry.
- **Encrypt personal memories**: capsules are private, strong-locked by AES-256-GCM.
- **Respect user agency**: if a user forgets their password, we cannot help. True ownership includes true risk.

We aren't just creating another chatbot. We're building a "compression algorithm for the self." That requires trust, and trust demands transparency and simplicity in system design.

## 🔄 Why Local-First Instead of Cloud-First

| Local-First | Cloud-First |
|:------------|:------------|
| User owns all memory data. | Provider owns memory copies. |
| No external points of failure. | External servers can be breached. |
| Works offline, forever. | Internet-dependent. |
| User sets security boundaries. | Invisible server-side policies. |

We chose Local-First because:
- **It matches the vision of "soul preservation."**
- **It gives full freedom and responsibility to the user.**
- **It drastically simplifies compliance and trust.**

Even if a user deletes Soul Capsule, they can still decrypt and preserve their capsules without us.

## 📊 Backend Structure Overview

| Layer | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| FastAPI | Core API engine (modular, fast) |
| Compression | Convert raw user input into stylized, compressed capsules |
| Storage | Flat-file or SQLite (planned) secure storage of capsules |
| Encryption | Optional capsule encryption via strong password protection |
| Decompression | Restore capsules back into detailed thought threads |

All layers are clean, separate, and easy to extend.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- ✅ SQLite fallback / JSON hybrid storage
- ✅ Real-time capsule tagging
- ✅ Frontend minimal UI (VSCode extension / Web-Electron hybrid)
- ✅ Capsule synchronization across devices (via secure local mesh)

**Always optional.** No cloud unless the user chooses.

## 🌈 Final Thought

> "Memory deserves to be free."

As developers, we are stewards, not owners, of the user's memories.
Every line of code should reflect that responsibility.

**Soul Capsule — Capture the Self. Secure the Self. Compress the Infinite.**
